## Project Background

Tech Haven, an e-commerce company founded in 2019, specializes in selling popular electronics like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad products. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to extract insights and deliver recommendations to improve performance across sales, product, and marketing teams.

## Executive Summary

Tech Havenâ€™s analysis of approximately 214k orders across 2020-2023 reveals a significant drop in annual revenue, as revenue in 2023 is nearly half of what it was in 2020. The surge in sales during 2020 and 2021 can largely be attributed to the pandemic. High-AOV products like laptops continue to generate the most revenue, while lower-cost items such as charging cables and batteries have a higher order count, but contribute less to overall revenue. Customer retention is a concern as unique and repeat purchase rates have declined by 39% and 61%, respectively. By targeting growth in the Midwest and Northeast regions and improving digital channels like the mobile app, Tech Haven can enhance customer loyalty, strengthen its market position, and drive sustainable growth.

## Recommendations

**Maximize Product Offerings**

- **Expand High-Performing Categories**: Increase catalog variations in laptops, phones, and monitors to meet diverse customer needs with premium models, driving repeat purchases and solidifying market presence.
- **Consider bundling lower-revenue products with high-revenue products**: Reevaluate the pricing strategy of charging cables and batteries, bundle them with high-value items, or offer them as a promotional gift to increase average order value (AOV) and revenue contribution.

**Customer Growth and Retention**

- **Boost Repeat Purchases**: Target single-purchase customers with personalized re-engagement campaigns and introduce tiered rewards within the loyalty program to incentivize frequent purchases and improve retention.
- **Leverage Core Customer Insights**: Analyze behaviors and preferences of repeat customers to enhance loyalty campaigns. Introduce referral incentives to drive word-of-mouth growth and increase new customer acquisition from existing networks.

**Loyalty Program Enhancements**

- **Enhance Loyalty Onboarding**: Implement targeted onboarding campaigns with first-purchase discounts or early access offers. Tiered rewards will further incentivize frequent purchases and strengthen customer loyalty.
- **Data-Driven Program Refinement**: Continuously monitor loyalty metrics to refine program offerings based on data, ensuring sustained engagement and effectiveness.

**Maintain Low Refund Rate**

- **Investigate Products with a High Refund Rate**: Analyze the factors behind the high return rate for products like the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor and the Bose SoundSport Headphones to identify potential quality or customer satisfaction issues and take steps to reduce future returns.

**Optimize Purchase Platform**

- **Enhance Mobile App Experience**: Improve the mobile app's checkout and personalization features to capitalize on rising mobile usage and increase its contribution to total sales.

**Regional Growth Strategies**

- **Focus on High Performing Regions**: Continue allocating resources to the South and West regions of the U.S. with regionalized marketing and product availability strategies tailored to local preferences.
