# Tech-Haven-Post-Pandemic-Analysis

# Project Background

Tech Haven, an e-commerce company founded in 2019, specializes in selling popular electronics like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad products. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to extract insights and deliver recommendations to improve performance across sales, product, and marketing teams.

# Executive Summary

Tech Haven's sales analysis of about 214k orders across 2020-2023 shows annual revenue significantly dropping since 2020.  Macbook Pro Laptops account for almost a quarter of all revenue. Tech Haven can benefit from expanding top product lines, optimizing bundling, and enhancing loyalty programs to increase customer lifetime value. Improvements to the mobile app will strengthen Tech Haven's market position and drive sustainable growth.

**Key Product Performance**

- The Macbook Pro Laptop, with its high AOV of $1,700, drives a large portion of revenue, making it a key focus for Tech Haven’s growth strategy.

- There's a stark contrast between premium products like the Macbook Pro and budget items like AA Batteries, highlighting the need for better product bundling strategies.

- Products like the iPhone and ThinkPad Laptop show strong performance and should be targeted for additional marketing efforts to capture more market share.

- Low-margin accessories like USB-C Charging Cables and Wired Headphones, with high order volumes, present opportunities for repeat purchases and customer loyalty programs.

- The Bose SoundSport Headphone’s high refund rate suggests potential issues with product quality or customer satisfaction, warranting investigation to reduce returns.
